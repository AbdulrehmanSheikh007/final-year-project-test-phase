# Student ID: BC140200856 - Test Phase Feb 25, 2020 *Students Management*

# Test Phase Problem Statement:
You are required to develop a simple user management system comprising of two interfaces to store and retrieve data to and from the database. The details of the interfaces are as follows:
# Interfaces:
1.	New User input 
2.	User list display with sorting feature 

# 1.	New User input 
This interface will have several input controls to take the input from user (detail is given below) and two buttons (Reset and submit).
Input Controls
The input controls with required constraints are given below:
•	Name
o	Must be at least 3 to 100 characters in length and only consist of alphabets
•	User Name
o	Must be 8 to 100 characters in length, should contain alphabets and alphanumeric characters with no special characters and space.
•	Password
o	Must be 8 to 20 characters in length
•	Email Address
o	Valid email address is required
Buttons Functionality
•	On clicking the Submit button, input should be validated and upon success, information should be entered in to the users table of the database and a success message should be displayed like “User Registered Successfully”.  In case of any invalid entry, a proper related error message should be displayed on the screen.

•	On clicking the Reset button, the input controls should be initialized to their default values.

# 2.	User list display with sorting feature 
This interface will display the list of all users that are already entered in the database containing all the fields. There will be sorting functionality required for this interface. 

Sorting functionality
There will be two buttons available in this interface which are “Sort ascending” and “Sort descending”. Upon clicking the “Sort ascending” button, the list of users should be displayed in ascending order based on User Name, and upon clicking the “sort descending” button the list should be displayed in descending order based on User Name.
